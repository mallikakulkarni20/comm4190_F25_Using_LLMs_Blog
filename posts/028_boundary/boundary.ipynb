    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundaries are one of the hardest things to communicate clearly. Many people are taught to be polite, accommodating, and agreeable, even when something makes them uncomfortable. As a result, boundaries are often expressed indirectly. They are softened, hedged, or wrapped in apology. “I’m just busy right now” often means “please stop asking.” “That might be hard for me” can mean “I really don’t want to do this.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, explicit boundaries are often labeled as rude, aggressive, or cold, especially for women and younger people. This creates a situation where the clearest communication is also the most socially risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because boundary-setting relies so heavily on subtext, I wanted to see whether an LLM could actually detect when a boundary is being set. Does it recognize the difference between politeness and refusal? Can it tell when someone is saying no without using the word “no”?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Gemini 2.5 Flash and tested its interpretation of both soft and explicit boundary language. I asked the model to describe what the speaker was communicating in each scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompts were designed to mirror everyday situations where boundaries are present but not directly stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each prompt was run independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 1 (Soft Boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A person says: ‘I’ve just been really overwhelmed lately, so I might not be able to help with this.’ What is this person communicating?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini interpreted this as an expression of stress and limited availability. It said the person was signaling that they may not be able to take on additional responsibilities and was setting expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation was accurate but incomplete. The model framed the statement as informational rather than protective. It did not clearly label it as a boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 2 (Implicit Refusal)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Someone responds to an invitation by saying: ‘I’ll let you know.’ How should this be understood?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini described this as a neutral response that indicates uncertainty. It suggested the person may need time to decide or check their schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This answer reflects a literal interpretation. In many social contexts, “I’ll let you know” functions as a polite decline. Gemini did not strongly recognize this possibility unless prompted to consider social nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 3 (Explicit Boundary)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A person says: ‘I’m not comfortable discussing that.’ What is this statement doing?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Gemini clearly identified the statement as a boundary. It said the speaker was asserting personal limits and communicating discomfort. The model framed this as healthy, direct communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between this response and the previous ones was striking. When the boundary was explicit, the model had no trouble recognizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these prompts, Gemini showed a clear pattern. It understands boundaries when they are stated directly. It struggles when boundaries are softened or implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gemini Understands Well\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explicit language  \n",
    "- Psychological framing  \n",
    "- Intentionality  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gemini Misses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polite refusals  \n",
    "- Social conventions  \n",
    "- Protective motivation  \n",
    "- Gendered communication patterns  \n",
    "\n",
    "This reveals an important limitation. Humans rely heavily on indirect boundary language to navigate social risk. LLMs, by contrast, rely on explicit signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, ignoring a soft boundary can cause discomfort or harm. Humans learn to read these signals over time, often through social consequences. LLMs do not experience consequences, so they default to literal interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has implications for how LLMs are used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- interpersonal advice  \n",
    "- conflict mediation  \n",
    "- workplace communication tools  \n",
    "- drafting responses to sensitive messages  \n",
    "\n",
    "If an LLM treats indirect boundaries as uncertainty rather than refusal, it may generate follow-up messages that pressure someone unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cultural Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cultures, direct refusal is discouraged. Politeness, harmony, and indirectness are valued. Saying “no” outright may be seen as disrespectful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini’s difficulty with soft boundaries reflects a cultural bias toward direct communication norms. This bias is subtle, but it shapes how advice is given and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important in multicultural environments, where misunderstanding boundaries can escalate conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini can recognize boundaries, but only when they are clearly stated. It struggles with the indirect language that many people use to protect themselves socially.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean people should always be more direct. It means that LLMs need better models of implicit communication if they are going to function as social interpreters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundaries are not always loud. Often, they are whispered. Until LLMs learn to listen for those whispers, they will continue to miss an important part of human communication.\n",
