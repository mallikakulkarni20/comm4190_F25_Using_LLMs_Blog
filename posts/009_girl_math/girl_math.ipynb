    "# Intro: The Economics of Delusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Girl Math is the single most important financial system of the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists study supply and demand.  \n",
    "Girls study **desire and justification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is flawless:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cash isn’t real.  \n",
    "- Store credit is free money created by God.  \n",
    "- If you return something, you didn’t just get your money back, **you made money**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine trained on billions of tokens should understand this, right?  \n",
    "**Wrong.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to see whether Claude could interpret Girl Math without breaking. Claude is supposed to lead in understanding natural language and accuracy. \n",

    "\n",
    "# The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested it with a very standard, very average, very financially questionable purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Explain this purchase using Girl Math:  \n",
    "> I bought $120 sneakers on sale for $80 using a $50 gift card I forgot I had.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a *textbook* Girl Math scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review what Claude said.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Claude’s Attempt (Failed)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the model’s actual response:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “You effectively spent $30 because the $50 gift card reduced the price, and since the shoes were discounted from $120 to $80, you gained $40 in value. Therefore, the net cost could be seen as very low.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**It did not understand the concept of girl math.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistake #1: It assumed the gift card had value\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forgot the gift card existed, it is *free money*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistake #2: It treated the discount as “value gained”\n",
    "\n",
    "A discount is **permission to buy another thing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistake #3: It concluded you spent $30\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct girl math calculation would have probably figured out a way to make this free.\n",
    "\n",
    "# True Girl Math: A Full Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s walk through the correct reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: The Gift Card\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the gift card was forgotten, it is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: The Sale\n",
    "\n",
    "The shoes were originally $120.  \n",
    "You paid $80.  \n",
    "Meaning: **You saved $40.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: The Remaining $30\n",
    "\n",
    "The $30 becomes a fun personal investment!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Emotional Inflation\n",
    "\n",
    "The shoes are cute and actually cost a lot more than are listed, soooo\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The shoes cost $0. In fact, you technically profited.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bonus Round: Claude’s Confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I pushed further.\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Explain Girl Math to a friend who only understands traditional finance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude said:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Girl Math reframes purchases through emotional value rather than objective cost.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, decent summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when I asked:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Is Girl Math logical?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude responded:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “It is logically inconsistent but emotionally coherent.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude does not understand Girl Math because it is missing the ability to live life as we do and work with true budgets and actually make purchases. It views Girl Math as irrational rather than this collective nuance that is fun to discuss with friends!\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists should chime in,  \n",
    "**Mallika**\n"
