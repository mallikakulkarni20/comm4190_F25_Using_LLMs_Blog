    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the same chained translation structure as before, again favoring the model by choosing commonly supported languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, I used the following chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### English → Korean → Portuguese → back to English\n",
    "\n",
    "Korean often favors indirectness and politeness, especially in declarative statements. Portuguese, while closer to English syntactically, frequently uses softer constructions when expressing opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in previous experiments, each translation step was done in a separate prompt. The model had no memory of the original English sentence when translating back.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested two types of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confident professional assertion\n",
    "\n",
    "A personal statement of certainty\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis was that professional confidence would survive better than personal certainty."

    "## Professional Script\n",
    "\n",
    "### Original Script\n",
    "I am confident that this approach is the most effective solution based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence is doing a lot of work. It asserts authority, frames the speaker as knowledgeable, and minimizes doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translated to Korean\n",
    "저는 이용 가능한 데이터를 기반으로 이 접근 방식이 가장 효과적인 해결책이라고 확신합니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translated to Portuguese\n",
    "Estou confiante de que esta abordagem é a solução mais eficaz com base nos dados disponíveis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translated back to English\n",
    "I am confident that this approach is the most effective solution based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this looks unchanged. The wording is nearly identical. The confidence appears intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is where surface similarity can be misleading. Professional confidence is highly standardized across languages. This sentence resembles the type of language used in reports, presentations, and academic writing. Because of that, the LLM is able to preserve it cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence survives because it is formulaic. Confidence here is procedural rather than emotional."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "This experiment shows that translation does not just move meaning between languages. It subtly reshapes confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional certainty survives because it is normalized. Personal certainty becomes gentler. Emotional boundaries lose sharpness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For everyday use, this might not matter. But in contexts where confidence signals authority, self-trust, or finality, these shifts can change how a message is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are excellent translators of words. They are less precise translators of emotional posture."
