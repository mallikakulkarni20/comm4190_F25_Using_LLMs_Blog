    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the same chained translation structure as before, again favoring the model by choosing commonly supported languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, I used the following chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### English → Japanese → French → back to English\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Japanese because it encodes politeness, hierarchy, and indirectness very differently from English. French, on the other hand, is syntactically closer to English but carries its own expectations around formality and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, each translation was done in a separate prompt with no shared context. The model had no memory of the original text when performing each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested two types of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "A professional but emotionally loaded message\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtle power-imbalance statement that relies heavily on tone\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis was that both would degrade, but in different ways."

    "### Translated back to English\n",
    "Thank you for your comments, but please understand that the final decision was made after a careful review of all available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this looks almost perfect. The meaning is preserved. The structure is intact. If you were grading this purely on semantic accuracy, you would give it full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "But something subtle has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original sentence carries a slightly defensive tone. It politely pushes back while asserting authority. In professional English, “I want to clarify” often signals controlled disagreement. The translated version replaces this with “please understand,” which softens the assertiveness and reframes the sentence as explanatory rather than corrective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not wrong. But it is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a professional setting, that difference matters. The translated version sounds less like a boundary and more like reassurance. Over repeated interactions, that shift could change how the speaker is perceived in terms of confidence or authority.\n"

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "This experiment reinforces something important about using LLMs in multilingual settings. Translation accuracy is not the same as communicative accuracy. A sentence can be perfectly translated and still fail to do its job socially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over multiple translations, tone does not shatter dramatically. It erodes slowly. Authority becomes politeness. Boundaries become explanations. Directness becomes neutrality."
