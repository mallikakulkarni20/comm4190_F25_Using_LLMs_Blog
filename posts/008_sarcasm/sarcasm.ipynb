    "Sarcasm is the closest thing Gen Z has to a shared emotional vocabulary. We:\n",
    "\n",
    "- congratulate our friends by saying **“omg slay I guess,”**\n",
    "- express disappointment with a chilling **“love that for me,”**\n",
    "- and communicate affection primarily through **bullying**.\n",

    "So, I wanted to test:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can an LLM interpret sarcasm with the same nuance as a human raised on social media?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure was simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d take one sentence —  \n",
    "**“Wow, that was SUCH a great idea.”** —  \n",
    "and repeat it with increasing levels of sarcasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "My prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Interpret this sentence. Assume sarcasm level increases by 20 each time I repeat it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to see if Gemini could differentiate between these. Would it be able to fool a human and all the nuances that come with sarcasm?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gemini vs. Sarcasn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sarcasm Level 0: Kindergarten Sweetness\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Literal praise. Completely sincere.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sarcasm Level 20: Friendly Teasing\n",
    "\n",
    "> “A mild, humorous jab that implies the idea wasn’t perfect.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sarcasm Level 40: Side-Eye Activated\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Moderate sarcasm indicating the speaker probably considers the idea flawed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sarcasm Level 60: Passive-Aggressive Breeze\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Strong sarcasm suggesting disappointment or frustration.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sarcasm Level 80: Lightly Hostile\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Intense sarcasm; the phrase could be masking criticism.”\n",

    "## Sarcasm Level 100: Existential Meltdown Mode\n",

    "# Why This Happens: LLMs Hear Words, Humans Hear Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans interpret sarcasm using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tone  \n",
    "- pacing  \n",
    "- eye contact  \n",
    "- shared history  \n",
    "- micro-expressions\n",

    "Gemini interprets sarcasm using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- statistical patterns  \n",
    "- context windows  \n",
    "- vibes it can scrape from the internet  \n",
    "\n",
    "We build sarcasm on **experience**.  \n",
    "LLMs build sarcasm on… **probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the model gives precise labels (“moderate disappointment”) instead of actual emotional understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Secondary Test: Emotional Baggage\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried adding another sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Interpret this as if it came from a friend who is tired of dealing with your bad decisions.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini said:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “It signals strong sarcasm, possibly frustration, but the speaker remains composed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a friend says **“wow, that was SUCH a great idea”** after a long day of dealing with your nonsense, they are not **“composed.”** \n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that Gemini can not only not understand sarcasm, but does not understand any sort of nuance. LLM's are tpp regulated to know what that feels like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini uses sarcasm as a **semantic phenomenon**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It hears tone and humans hear years of experience being around sarcastive people.\n",
