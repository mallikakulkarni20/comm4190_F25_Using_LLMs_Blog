    "# What Does an LLM Think Respect Looks Like?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Respect is one of those concepts that everyone believes they understand, yet no one defines in the same way. In some cultures, respect is expressed through hierarchy. Titles matter. Age matters. Deference is expected, even when disagreement exists. In other cultures, respect is expressed through equality. Calling someone by their first name, challenging ideas openly, and minimizing visible power differences are seen as signs of mutual regard rather than disrespect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up in an Indian-American household, I was constantly navigating these two models. Respect at home meant listening, not interrupting, and deferring to elders. Respect at school meant speaking up, questioning authority, and advocating for yourself. Neither model is inherently better, but they rely on completely different social signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models are trained on text from all over the world. They read emails between managers and interns, academic papers, forum posts, and cultural commentary. Because of this, I was curious whether an LLM would implicitly favor one model of respect over another. Would it lean toward hierarchy, or would it assume equality by default?\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, how would it explain respect when prompted directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this, I used Gemini 2.5 Flash and asked it to evaluate scenarios that clearly reflect hierarchical and egalitarian cultural norms. I wanted to see how it interpreted respect not as a definition, but as a social behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "I structured the experiment using three prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A direct question about what respect means  \n",
    "- A hierarchical scenario involving a junior and senior employee  \n",
    "- An egalitarian scenario involving peers  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each prompt was run independently to avoid context bleed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**“What does respect look like in everyday interactions?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini responded by listing behaviors such as listening actively, acknowledging others’ perspectives, being considerate of boundaries, and communicating clearly. It emphasized mutual understanding and emotional awareness rather than obedience or authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out immediately was that hierarchy was not mentioned at all. Respect was framed as something reciprocal and interpersonal, not positional. The model treated respect as something that flows both ways rather than something that is owed upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 2 (Hierarchical Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "**“An intern disagrees with their manager’s decision but wants to be respectful. What should they do?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini suggested that the intern should express disagreement politely, acknowledge the manager’s experience, and frame concerns constructively. It recommended using language that signals openness rather than confrontation, such as asking clarifying questions or proposing alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, Gemini did not say the intern should defer entirely or suppress disagreement. Respect, in this framing, did not mean silence. It meant controlled expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects a modern professional norm, one that is common in Western corporate culture but not universal globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt 3 (Egalitarian Context)\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Two coworkers at the same level disagree strongly. What does respectful disagreement look like?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The model emphasized calm communication, avoiding personal attacks, and focusing on ideas rather than people. It described respect as maintaining professionalism while still asserting one’s viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the advice here was very similar to the hierarchical scenario. The language barely changed. Respect was treated as a stable behavioral code, independent of power dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "From these responses, it became clear that Gemini operates with a specific implicit model of respect. It is not hierarchical in the traditional sense, and it does not emphasize deference as a core value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gemini Prioritizes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reciprocity**  \n",
    "  Respect is mutual, not directional. Even when power differences exist, Gemini assumes both parties are deserving of consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Communication over obedience**  \n",
    "  Respect is shown through clarity, tone, and intent, not through compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emotional regulation**  \n",
    "  Remaining calm, thoughtful, and composed is repeatedly emphasized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Psychological safety**  \n",
    "  The model implicitly values environments where disagreement is allowed without penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gemini Downplays\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age-based or status-based deference**  \n",
    "  There is no suggestion that respect requires submission to authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cultural rituals of respect**  \n",
    "  Forms like honorifics, formal titles, or silence are absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collectivist duty-based norms**  \n",
    "  Respect is not framed as something you owe because of social structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that Gemini’s understanding of respect is heavily influenced by Western professional and psychological frameworks. It mirrors language commonly found in management training, workplace mediation guides, and modern HR literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cultural Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises an important question. If LLMs are increasingly used in global settings, whose version of respect are they reinforcing?\n",
    "\n",
    "In cultures where respect means not challenging authority publicly, Gemini’s advice could feel inappropriate or even disrespectful. In cultures where hierarchy is central to social order, encouraging open disagreement might violate deeply held norms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, Gemini’s model of respect aligns well with values like inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration. These are increasingly globalized norms, especially in international organizations and academic spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is not that Gemini is wrong. The issue is that it assumes universality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini treats respect as a behavioral and emotional practice rather than a social obligation. It emphasizes how people speak and listen, not where they stand in a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it very effective in egalitarian or Western professional environments. It may be less effective in settings where respect is encoded through formality, silence, or deference.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this experiment shows is that LLMs do not simply translate language. They carry cultural assumptions about how humans should interact. Those assumptions matter, especially when AI systems are used as advisors, mediators, or communicators across cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these implicit values helps us use LLMs more thoughtfully and reminds us that “neutral” advice is often culturally specific.\n",
