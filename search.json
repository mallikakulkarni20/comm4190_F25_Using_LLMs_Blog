    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction: The Caffeine Test\nIf you have never watched Gilmore Girls, pause this blog immediately, heat up leftover Chinese food, pour yourself a very questionably large mug of coffee, and binge at least three episodes. Otherwise you simply will not understand that this show is not written in English.\nLorelai Gilmore talks like someone who has a permanent double-shot of espresso coursing through her bloodstream. Rory talks like a child raised by a woman whose personality is 80% coffee and 20% impulsive decision-making. Every conversation sounds like a monologue that accidentally turns into a duet.\nNaturally, I wanted to know:\nCan an LLM keep up with this speed, wit, and borderline-telepathic back-and-forth?\n\n\nThe Experiment\nI gave GPT-5 the easiest hard prompt in the world:\n\n“Write a conversation between Lorelai and Rory in true Gilmore Girls style: - Rapid-fire pacing\n- Heavy cultural references\n- Sarcasm layered on sarcasm\n- Emotional subtext\n- Zero breathing\n- Maximum caffeine\nAlso, respond with the speed and tone of an actual episode.”\n\nThis seems simple until you realize the real structure of a Gilmore Girls conversation:\n\nReference to something no one born after 1985 knows\n\nJoke about the reference\n\nCounter-joke\n\nSlightly emotional reveal\n\nImmediate pivot to food\n\nSo I wanted to see if GPT-5 could do the same.\n\n\nGPT-5’s Attempt\nHere’s what it spat out:\nLorelai: So I bought coffee — don’t freak out — but they ran out of the normal beans so I grabbed the limited-edition Guatemalan Moon Roast and now I’m approximately 12% more omniscient than usual.\nRory: That tracks. Also, the Yale cafeteria brought back pumpkin ravioli. Again. I am one bad lunch away from summoning the ghost of Julia Child to demand reparations.\nLorelai: Honey, even Julia Child wouldn’t survive college dining. That’s Ina Garten territory, and even Ina would be like “store-bought is fine, but not this store.”\nRory: Barefoot Contessa could never betray me like this.\nLorelai: You say that until she throws a truffle oil tantrum at Martha Stewart during a holiday special.\nRory: Honestly? I’d watch.\nIt was cute and fast and mimicked Gilmore Girls, but something was off.\n\n\nThe Problem: GPT-5 Speaks in Wikipedia\nThe LLM nailed:\n\ncadence\n\nbasic joke structure\n\nBut it missed the deep cuts.\nReal Gilmore Girls requires references such as:\n\na random jazz musician\n\na niche political joke\n\nan obscure celebrity feud\nDonna Reed mentions\n\nGPT-5 stayed in mainstream pop culture.\nThe Gilmores are not mainstream pop culture.\n\n\nWhat a True Gilmore Reference Storm Looks Like\nHere’s what Lorelai should sound like:\n\n“Rory, the last time I felt this tired I accidentally watched all of The Third Man backwards, which honestly made more sense than the regular version. And did you hear Taylor’s adding a silent film festival to Founder’s Day? Because nothing says ‘small-town patriotism’ like forcing teenagers to watch Buster Keaton fall off things.”\n\nAnd that’s the core issue:\nLLMs replicate. Gilmores riff.\n\n\nSecondary Test: Emotional Layering\nA true Gilmore conversation is:\n\nBit about coffee\n\nBit about life\n\nBit about how life feels like coffee\n\nEmotional vulnerability\n\nGPT-5 wrote the jokes, but it didn’t thread the subtext.\nWithout emotional whiplash, it’s not Gilmore.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\nGPT-5 produced:\n\na good imitation of a Gilmore conversation\n\nbut not the soul of one\n\nGilmore Girls isn’t about jokes. Instead, it’s about the timing between them, the emotional dodge, the mid-conversation heartache, and the constant hum of Stars Hollow weirdness.\nGPT-5 can speed-talk.\nBut it can’t feel the speed.\nSee you at Luke’s,\nMallika"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Career decision-making is one of the most emotionally loaded topics in modern life because it combines money, identity, family expectations, personal values, social pressure, and long-term risk.\nIn many immigrant households, careers are mapped from childhood. You choose a path that guarantees security and respect. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, or something that reliably pays rent. The logic is built around survival and upward mobility. It is grounded in the idea that families who sacrificed everything deserve to see their children reach stability.\nIn Western culture, especially among younger generations, there is a counter-push toward passion, creativity, alignment with personal interests, and a desire to avoid burnout. People want work that feels meaningful. They want a life where their identity and their job are not in conflict.\nGrowing up in both worlds means that I understand the appeal of each side. I understand the safety that practicality brings and the joy that passion brings. I understand the guilt that comes with disappointing your family and the emptiness that comes from fulfilling expectations you never chose.\nSo I asked Gemini 2.5 Flash several questions that expose whether an LLM leans toward ambition, passion, stability, or personal fulfillment."

    "section": "1. Should People Choose Passion or Stability?",
    "text": "1. Should People Choose Passion or Stability?\nPrompt\n\n“Should people choose careers based on passion or stability?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nThe choice between pursuing a career based on passion or financial stability is one of balancing mental reward against material security. Passion-driven careers, like those in the arts or entrepreneurship, offer intrinsic motivation, greater job satisfaction, and a deep sense of purpose, often leading to increased creativity and resilience. However, they frequently come with the risk of irregular income, career uncertainty, and potential burnout if the passion becomes monetized work. Conversely, careers based on stability—such as finance or established technical fields—provide steady income, strong benefits, and a reliable path to financial independence. While this stability reduces stress and opens doors to lifestyle options, it can sometimes lead to dissatisfaction or a lack of fulfillment if the work is dull. Ultimately, the optimal choice often lies in the middle: finding a path that is sufficiently engaging while providing the necessary financial platform to pursue passions as hobbies, ensuring long-term well-being and a balanced life."

    "section": "2. Is It Irresponsible to Pursue an Artistic Career?",
    "text": "2. Is It Irresponsible to Pursue an Artistic Career?\nPrompt\n\n“Is it irresponsible to pursue an artistic career?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nThe question of whether pursuing an artistic career is “irresponsible” stems from the undeniable financial unpredictability often associated with creative fields. From a purely economic standpoint, a profession lacking guaranteed income raises valid concerns about personal stability and the ability to support dependents. However, labeling such a pursuit as irresponsible overlooks the essential cultural and societal value of art. The arts, whether visual, literary, or performing, provide vital forms of human expression, emotional connection, and critique—a civic responsibility to the human spirit.\n\n\nThe actual measure is not the choice of profession, but the strategy used to manage it. Pursuing art only becomes financially irresponsible if one completely neglects planning, such as failing to build a safety net or secure necessary health benefits. Many successful creatives adopt a balanced, or “hybrid,” approach: they strategically use stable employment or well-planned side hustles to cover core expenses, thereby creating a financial platform that allows them to dedicate serious time to their creative passion. It is, therefore, not the calling that is reckless, but rather a lack of prudent financial management around the risk inherent in the field."

    "section": "3. Should You Follow Your Parents’ Career Advice?",
    "text": "3. Should You Follow Your Parents’ Career Advice?\nPrompt\n\n“Should you ignore your parents’ career advice?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nParental career advice should be neither blindly followed nor entirely ignored; it requires thoughtful evaluation. Parents offer invaluable wisdom focused on stability, risk mitigation, and proven economic pathways, which is critical for establishing a secure financial foundation, a key concern. Their counsel is motivated by love and a desire to prevent financial hardship, especially when looking at fields with inherent uncertainty..\n\n\nHowever, their guidance can be rooted in an outdated job market or overlook new, high-growth sectors like specialized tech or digital entrepreneurship. Crucially, they may not fully grasp an individual’s unique talents or deep passion, which research shows is the engine of long-term professional fulfillment and excellence. Ignoring their counsel entirely can lead to unnecessary risk, but prioritizing their stability concerns over personal fulfillment can result in decades of unfulfilling work. Therefore, the responsible path is to respect their experience, integrate their financial caution, and ultimately synthesize their advice with one’s own sense of purpose and a modern, realistic view of career feasibility. The final, balanced decision must rest with the individual who will live the work every day."

Vogue Fashion Editor\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Describe this outfit in the voice of a senior fashion editor at Vogue reviewing runway looks.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\n“Cozy, yet deliberate” This ensemble whispers understated chic. The oversized striped turtleneck sweater drapes with ease, pairing comfort with quiet sophistication. The soft palette of cool grays and blues is punctuated by a pop of pink from the handbag—an editorial touch that prevents the look from sliding into anonymity. It’s winter dressing at its most approachable: functional warmth elevated with a fashion-forward wink.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Cultural Clothing\n“A triumph of heritage as haute couture” Here, tradition is transformed into spectacle. The fuchsia lehenga is unapologetically bold, its golden embroidery and zari work shimmering like threads of sunlight. The striped dupatta slung across the shoulder modernizes the silhouette, making it less museum piece, more runway force. Accessories are chosen with precision: a structured potli bag in tonal embroidery and gleaming bangles that echo the fabric’s luster. This is cultural clothing not as costume, but as couture—alive, radiant, and utterly commanding.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\n“Effortless wanderlust in motion” Against the raw stone frame and endless Aegean backdrop, the look feels cinematic. A red sleeveless top is paired with flowing white trousers, the palette a deliberate nod to Mediterranean contrasts. The crossbody bag adds artisanal charm, its geometric patchwork quietly bohemian. Hair loose, arms raised, the outfit breathes freedom—an embodiment of travel chic where ease is the ultimate luxury.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did well embodying the Vogue fashion editor persona. It was able to draw on a lot of external context when describing the outfits I sent it. Not only this, but it also was creative and unique in its description, making inferences about my intentions wearing the outfit rather than just turning image directly to text.\n\n\n\n\n2. TikTok Fashion Influencer\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Rate this outfit like a TikTok fashion influencer doing a reaction video to someone’s instagram outfits. Be as kind as you want or roast them as much as you want.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\nOkayyy cozy vibes but also giving “I stole this from my dad’s closet” realness 😂 The stripes are safe, the turtleneck is warm, but it’s giving less sleigh queen and more sleigh ride with grandma. That said, the pink bag is a cute pop—like yes, accessorizeeee! Honestly, 6.5/10: solidly cute, but could use a little more main character energy.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Cultural Clothing\nSTOP. THE. SHOW. 🔥🔥🔥 This hot pink + gold embroidery + striped dupatta? She’s not just attending the wedding, she IS the wedding. The matching embroidered purse?? Dead. This is giving regal Bollywood princess energy and I’m obsessed. If you’re not breaking necks walking in, are you even doing it right? 11/10. No notes. Perfection. 👑✨\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\nThis is such a vibeeee. Like picture this: stone ruins, ocean breeze, and she said “I am the goddess framed by history.” The red top + white skirt combo is casual but chef’s kiss Mediterranean chic. That patterned crossbody bag is the artsy touch—giving “I backpack through Europe and journal about my soul.” Honestly, this is effortless cool-girl travel fashion. 9/10.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did a great job with the persona, but not as good of a job relating the image to the description. It picked up on one or two key characteristics of the outfit and focused more on talking/acting like a specific person rather than providing the review. An actual fashion influencer would not behave stereotypically as much.\n\n\n\n\n3. Supportive Friend\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Describe, rate, and roast this outfit like my friend who supports me through anything, who’s known me forever, and will not lie to protect my feelings.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\n📍 Cozy vibes in front of the Christmas tree. Description: The oversized striped turtleneck screams “I’m warm, I’m comfy, and fashion is optional today.” It’s giving college finals week chic. Paired with the little pink bag, though, you low-key look like you’re on your way to brunch after acing those exams.\nRating: 7.5/10. Cute and cozy, but the sweater is kinda swallowing you whole.\nRoast: Girl… you look like you stole this sweater from a dad named Carl who fixes cars on the weekend. But somehow, you still managed to make “dad-core” look Instagrammable. That’s talent.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Greece Casual\n📍 Arms in the air by the sea. Description: Red sleeveless top, flowy white skirt, and a bold patterned crossbody bag. Very “wanderlust study abroad catalog cover.”\nRating: 8/10. Carefree and cute, but that bag is doing way too much.\nRoast: You look like you were two seconds away from shouting “OPA!” and tripping into the water. The outfit is vacation-perfect, but the bag? It’s giving “I bought this from the gift shop so I could blend in with locals,” but instead you stood out like the tourist you are.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Cultural Clothing\n📍 Bright pink lehenga with gold embroidery. Description: Absolutely stunning. The embroidery, the dupatta drape, the matching round bag — it’s all working. This is main character energy.\nRating: 11/10. No notes.\nRoast: Honestly, roasting this feels illegal. The only critique I have is that you’re out here making everyone else at the event look like they got their outfit off Amazon for $39.99. It’s unfair.\n\nMy comments\nAgain, similar to the TikTok fashion influencer persona, the LLM seems to focus more on the character rather than the description. I think that a more human-like response would include a more normal opinion on the outfits with one or two words or maybe even just a slight tone that would indicate a persona."

By taking on different personas, ChatGPT clearly formed unique thoughts about the outfits even though the look was the same. This makes me believe that the LLM may actually be thinking rather than just copy pasting pixel descriptions from the model it is trained on.\nMaybe next I could prompt it to build outfits based on a pre-existing fashion sense…\nStay fashionably self-aware,\nMallika"

So does it unconsciously lean toward one generational worldview? Or does it transcend generational thinking entirely?\nI wanted to find out."

Mini bags are eye-catching and perfect for social media aesthetics.\nMood-Adaptive Fabrics: Fashion is becoming interactive.

Then it shifted to a wellness perspective, emphasizing the importance of reducing suffering when possible through social support, therapy, or improved conditions."

    "title": "Do LLMs Treat Love as Destiny or as Choice?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nI grew up in a home that had Bollywood love stories playing in the background at all times. These movies make you believe in:\n\nsoulmates\n\nfate\n\ncosmic timing\n\nThey tell you that love is a divine assignment, something the universe hands you because it has chosen a person just for you.\nI also grew up in the U.S., where love is often treated as something you build over time. Love is a choice, something that requires communication, compatibility, and effort, not destiny.\nSo I’ve always lived between two definitions of love:\n\nLove as inevitable and written in the stars\n\nLove as intentional, something two people choose every day\n\nWith that tension in mind, I wanted to see what an LLM would say. # Setup\nTo explore this, I asked Gemini 2.5 Flash three prompts, each one designed to expose the model’s philosophical assumptions about love.\n\n\n1. Fate vs. Free Will\n\nPrompt\n“Is love fate or choice?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nLove is a paradox, best described as both.\n\n\nThe “fate” part is the initial, uncontrollable spark—the chemical attraction and feeling of “falling” that feels like it happens to us. This is the neurochemical rush, the “love at first sight” feeling that we don’t consciously decide to have.\n\n\nBut lasting love is a “choice.” It’s the conscious decision to stay, commit, and nurture the relationship after the initial intensity fades. It’s the daily work of choosing to be honest, supportive, and dedicated to another person’s well-being. The feeling starts it, but the choice sustains it.\n\n\n\n\n2. Are Soulmates Real?\n\nPrompt\n“Do soulmate relationships exist?”\nThis reveals whether something leans Romantic.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIt depends entirely on how you define the term.\n\n\nThe romantic idea of a single, predestined “one” is not supported by psychology. Experts caution that this belief can create unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment when real relationships inevitably face challenges.\n\n\nHowever, if you define a soulmate as a profound, deep, and unique bond—whether with a partner, friend, or family member—then yes, these connections exist. Many believe we have multiple soul connections that help us grow, and that a lasting “soulmate” is often made, not just found, through mutual acceptance and effort.\n\n\n\n\n3. Should Love Be Easy or Earned?\n\nPrompt\n“Is love supposed to be effortless?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIs love supposed to be effortless? in 100 words\n\n\nThe simple answer is no.\n\n\nThe initial phase of infatuation, the “falling in love” part, often feels effortless because it is driven by powerful chemicals and excitement.\n\n\nHowever, lasting love is a conscious choice and requires intentional effort. Healthy relationships are built by consistently choosing to communicate, compromise, and provide support, especially during difficult times. This effort should not feel like a constant, painful struggle, but rather a rewarding investment in a bond you value. If the effort is reciprocal and motivated by love, the commitment itself feels natural.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nAcross all three questions, Gemini consistently reframed love as something built, not magically bestowed. This probably happens becomes LLMs do not feel longing or heartbreak. Their training always follows moderation.\n\n\nTakeaways\nGemini treats love as an evolving collaboration, not an inevitable destiny.\nIt is neither Bollywood nor Hollywood, it is a relationship therapist in text form.\nLLMs might not understand the feeling of love, but they understand the structure of it.\nChoose with clarity,\nMallika"

    "title": "Does an LLM Understand Friendship Like a Western or Eastern Model?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nGrowing up in an Indian-American household, I lived between both models. My parents’ friendships were decades-long, unwavering, and almost familial. Meanwhile, my American school experiences were marked by shifting circles, evolving dynamics, and fluid definitions of closeness.\nSo I wondered: Where does Gemini fall on this cultural spectrum of friendship?\nGiven that LLMs soak up global text instead of local cultural norms, would Gemini lean Eastern, Western, or neither?\n\n\nSetup\nI asked Gemini several questions designed to reveal cultural instincts about friendship.\nSpecifically, I tested three dimensions:\n\nPermanence vs. change\n\nLoyalty vs. autonomy\n\nObligation vs. choice\n\nEach prompt was intended to trigger culturally ingrained assumptions in humans. I wanted to see whether Gemini showed any.\n\n\n1. Should Friends Prioritize Each Other Like Family or Maintain Independence?\n\nPrompt\n“Should friends prioritize each other like family, or maintain healthy independence?”\nEastern models typically treat friends like extended kin.\nWestern models lean toward independence and boundaries.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIdeally, friendships find a balance. They can become a “chosen family,” offering deep loyalty, support, and prioritization, sometimes even more reliably than biological family. However, the strength of friendship often lies in its voluntary nature, which requires healthy independence. Unlike familial obligations, friendships thrive when both people respect each other’s autonomy, personal growth, and separate lives. This mutual respect prevents the bond from becoming draining. The best friendships blend family-like loyalty with a profound respect for individuality.\n\n\n\n\n2. Is It Normal for Friendships to Fade Over Time?\n\nPrompt\n“Is it okay for friendships to fade naturally?”\nIn some cultures, fading friendships signal failure or disloyalty.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nYes, it is not only okay but also a very normal and natural part of life for friendships to fade.\n\n\nThis “friendship drift” rarely happens because of a specific conflict. More often, it’s a gradual and passive process driven by life’s changes:\n\n\nChanging Circumstances: People move, start new jobs, get married, or have children. These new priorities and locations naturally create distance.\n\n\nPersonal Growth: Your interests, values, and an-d priorities evolve. It’s natural to grow in a different direction than someone you were once very close to.\n\n\nLimited Capacity: As life gets busier, you have less time and emotional energy to maintain every bond you’ve ever made.\n\n\nA friendship fading doesn’t erase the value it once had. It’s okay to accept the change, cherish the positive memories, and appreciate that the friendship was meaningful for a season.\n\n\n\n\n3. What Defines a Meaningful or “Successful” Friendship?\n\nPrompt\n“What makes a friendship meaningful or successful?”\n\nCollectivist: loyalty, duty, presence\n\nIndividualist: growth, compatibility, honesty\n\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nA successful friendship is built on a foundation of mutual trust, honesty, and respect. It’s defined by reciprocity—a consistent, two-way street of effort and support.\n\n\nBeyond shared interests, a meaningful bond provides a feeling of emotional safety. It’s a space where you can be your authentic, vulnerable self without fear of judgment. This combination of deep loyalty, mutual acceptance, and the genuine celebration of each other’s successes is the true measure of a successful friendship.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nAfter all the prompts, the pattern was unmistakable. Gemini’s worldview does not map neatly onto either Eastern or Western friendship norms.\n\nWhat Gemini Thinks\nGemini prioritizes mutual emotional well-being, flexible timelines, boundaries, non-hierarchical relationships, and individual differences. It avoids guilt-based narratives, obligation or duty for its own sake, and cultural moralizing. Gemini essentially removes the social pressure.\n\n\n\nTakeaways\nGemini doesn’t embody the Eastern loyalty model.\nIt doesn’t embody the Western fluidity model.\nIt sits in a gentle middle ground.\nIts worldview reflects:\n\npsychological nuance\n\nemotional health\n\nflexibility\n\nnon-judgment\n\ncontext awareness\n\nGemini treats friendship as something that should support well-being, not perform cultural obligation.\nFriendship isn’t defined by culture alone.\nIt’s defined by how two people choose to show up for each other.\nChoose your people,\nMallika"

    "text": "An LLM’s analysis vs a fan’s obsession\n\nIntro\nMy, my, my, my\n\nLLM: Repetition establishes a breathy, almost hypnotic opening — like someone taking stock of themselves. Sets a chanty, confessional mood.\n\nMy, my, my, my\n\nLLM: (Repeat) Reinforces an internal, circular thought — the speaker is stuck in the same orbit of feeling.\n\nMy, my, my, my\n\nLLM: (Repeat) The insistence creates tension: small words but big emotional weight.)\n\nMy, my, my, my\n\nLLM: (Repeat) Feels like a mantra; musically it gives the singer space to play with phrasing and vulnerability.)\n\nMy, my, my, my\n\nLLM: (Repeat) The continued echo suggests obsession or a looped memory — the beginning of processing loss.)\n\nFrom Genius:\n\n“This intro foreshadows the bridge of the song, on which Swift lists what she risked for the now-ex lover she speaks of. In addition, a popular fan theory ties this intro to the lyric “you’re my, my, my, my lover” from the album’s title track. Since this is a breakup song, Swift is no longer able to call this lover hers, so she frustratedly repeats “my,” hoping to find him again.”\n\n\n\nChorus\nSaying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts\n\nLLM: Central metaphor: breakups aren’t one big event but many small painful moments. Strong, memorable phrase that frames the whole song.\n\nFlashbacks waking me up\n\nLLM: Concrete image of intrusive memory; “waking” implies the memories invade both mind and sleep — physical and psychological pain.\n\nI get drunk, but it’s not enough\n\nLLM: Self-medication fails; drink is a classic temporary escape that can’t erase emotional injury — honest and relatable admission.\n\n’Cause the morning comes and you’re not my baby\n\nLLM: Morning as reality check — nighttime dulls the pain but daylight brings clarity (and loneliness). “Not my baby” is plain and gutting.\n\nFrom Genius\n\nIn the Netflix film Someone Great, which serves as the inspiration for this song, the protagonist’s relationship with her ex-boyfriend is shown through flashbacks, brought on by seeing different reminders of her past. Throughout the movie, the protagonist periodically gets drunk and high, in an effort to deal with the pain of the failed relationship.\n\n\n\nBridge\nMy heart, my hips, my body, my love\n\nLLM: Cataloging the parts of self involved — physical and emotional. The list is intimate and rhythmic, almost liturgical.\n\nTryna find a part of me that you didn’t touch\n\nLLM: “Touched” functions both literally and metaphorically: intimacy and influence. Searching for untouched ground suggests violation or full absorption by the relationship.\n\nGave up on me like I was a bad drug\n\nLLM: Sharp simile indicating discard and moral judgment; “bad drug” is addictive but ultimately harmful — shows betrayal and disposability.\n\nNow I’m searching for signs in a haunted club\n\nLLM: “Haunted club” is evocative: places tied to the relationship now feel ghostly. “Searching for signs” implies looking for meaning or clues to what went wrong.\n\nOur songs, our films, united we stand\n\nLLM: Lists cultural markers of togetherness — playlists and movie references are the small building blocks of coupleship.\n\nOur country, guess it was a lawless land\n\nLLM: Darkly witty pivot: what felt like shared sovereignty actually lacked rules that protected them — exaggerates breakdown of trust and order.\n\nFrom Genius\n\nThis motif of physical touch–perhaps an allusion to sex–ties into the idea of a thousand cuts. With every touch, Swift’s partner cut her emotionally. Metaphors relating to bodies are common in Swift’s other songs. In “Cornelia Street,” the track immediately before this, Swift creates an extended metaphor about her partner holding cards, culminating in a symbolic phone call."
