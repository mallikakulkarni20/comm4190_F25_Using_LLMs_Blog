    "section": "",
    "text": "Johns Creek, Georgia is not a city that usually shows up in travel guides or “top 10 places to visit” lists. It is a suburban town outside Atlanta, known more for good schools, parks, and family neighborhoods than for nightlife or tourist attractions. For people who grow up there, Johns Creek is defined by routine. Soccer fields, strip malls, community centers, and long drives. It is a place you live, not a place you visit.\nBecause of that, I was curious how an LLM would interpret a town like Johns Creek. LLMs tend to do well with major cities, famous landmarks, and places that generate lots of online content. Johns Creek is quieter. Its culture is local, repetitive, and not especially visible on the internet.\nSo I wanted to test how an LLM finds and evaluates activities in a place that is familiar to its residents but relatively invisible to outsiders. Would it capture the reality of the town, or would it flatten it into generic suburban recommendations?"

The town itself was described as having limited cultural offerings, with real “culture” existing elsewhere.\nThis reflects a broader pattern in how LLMs treat suburbs. Culture is assumed to live in cities. Suburbs are treated as extensions rather than as places with their own rhythms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "My reasoning for choosing to read SUperagency may have been different than others. When we were given the choice to rank books based on how much we wanted to read them, and were given this wide scale betweeen pro and anti AI books, it took me some time to decide what I wanted to do. I have always been a gloomer and doomer about AI and what it is doing to the human mind and psyche, so the clear choice was to read books by authors who were also worried about this as well as bias in AI systems. However, I was presented a chance to flip the narrative for myself. While I was wary about this, I was excited about the opportunity to force myself way out of my comfort zone. At the very least, I would be able to understand the other side.\nWhat makes this even more complex for me is that I am a Computer Science major. This means that on a daily basis, I do not just battle what AI does to society but I battle what it does for my education and for my job. So while I remain negative on the subject, I thought it would be nice to shine some positivity on the subject. At the end of the semester, regardless of how much I enjoyed reading the book, it did do that for me. The book made it harder for me to hold onto simplistic narratives about AI, whether optimistic or pessimistic.\nBefore reading it, I tended to frame AI in terms of risk management. What could go wrong. Who might be harmed. How systems fail. Those questions still matter deeply to me, but the book pushed me to also ask what could go right, and under what conditions.\nThe book’s arguments depend heavily on the assumption that we will choose to design AI in ways that expand agency broadly rather than concentrate it. History gives me reasons to doubt that assumption. However, if anything, the book made me more interested in reading further. Not just about AI capabilities, but about governance, institutional design, and historical analogies. I want to read books that interrogate who gets to define agency in the first place. And read more from authors with this perspective. The authors of this book are so deep rooted in AI (in a financial sense as well), so it would be nice to read a pro-AI book by authors that do not depend on it for their livelihood. Because, at the end of the day, this book was a marketing tactic for their business lives!\nI am excited, but with conditions. Excited by the possibility that AI could help people think better, learn faster, and act more deliberately. I left with better questions, and a clearer sense that the future of AI is not something that happens to us. It is something we participate in, whether we intend to or not."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Some books change how you think. Others change the sentences that replay in your head. Superagency did both, but what surprised me most was how many lines I underlined. Not because they were dramatic, but because they were precise. They put language to intuitions I had not fully articulated.\nOne recurring theme I kept highlighting was the idea that agency is structured. The book repeatedly emphasizes that our capacity to act meaningfully depends on the systems around us. That framing felt especially relevant in conversations about AI, where responsibility is often misplaced onto individual users rather than designers or institutions.\nI was drawn to passages that rejected technological determinism. Lines that stressed that AI does not arrive with fixed social consequences, but acquires them through deployment choices. That idea is not new, but it is stated here with unusual clarity. It cuts through both hype and panic by insisting that outcomes are contingent.\nAnother set of highlights focused on augmentation. I loved the emphasis on AI as a collaborator rather than a competitor. The language around “expanding the action space” stuck with me. It reframes intelligence not as a zero-sum resource, but as something that can be distributed and scaffolded.\nThere were also quieter moments that stayed with me. Reflections on how tools subtly reshape what we consider possible. How convenience can narrow agency if it removes opportunities for deliberation. Those sections felt less like a manifesto and more like a warning written in lowercase.\nI appreciated that the book does not shy away from tradeoffs. Some of my favorite quotes acknowledged that increasing agency for some can reduce it for others if systems are poorly designed. That honesty made the optimistic claims more credible.\nWhat I enjoyed most overall was the tone. It was confident without being dismissive, hopeful without being saccharine. The quotes I marked were not trying to persuade through spectacle. They were trying to clarify.\nBy the end, my margins were crowded. Not with rebuttals, but with connections. To things I have studied, built, worried about. That is usually how I know a book worked. Not because it convinced me of everything, but because it gave me better language to argue with myself."

Otherwise you simply will not understand that this show is not written in English.\nLorelai Gilmore talks like someone who has a permanent double-shot of espresso coursing through her bloodstream. Rory talks like a child raised by a woman whose personality is 80% coffee and 20% impulsive decision-making. Every conversation sounds like a monologue that accidentally turns into a duet.\nNaturally, I wanted to know:\nCan an LLM keep up with this speed, wit, and borderline-telepathic back-and-forth?\n\n\nThe Experiment\nI gave GPT-5 the easiest hard prompt in the world:\n\n“Write a conversation between Lorelai and Rory in true Gilmore Girls style: - Rapid-fire pacing\n- Heavy cultural references\n- Sarcasm layered on sarcasm\n- Emotional subtext\n- Zero breathing\n- Maximum caffeine\nAlso, respond with the speed and tone of an actual episode.”\n\nThis seems simple until you realize the real structure of a Gilmore Girls conversation:\n\nReference to something no one born after 1985 knows\n\nJoke about the reference\n\nCounter-joke\n\nSlightly emotional reveal\n\nImmediate pivot to food\n\nSo I wanted to see if GPT-5 could do the same.\n\n\nGPT-5’s Attempt\nHere’s what it spat out:\nLorelai: So I bought coffee — don’t freak out — but they ran out of the normal beans so I grabbed the limited-edition Guatemalan Moon Roast and now I’m approximately 12% more omniscient than usual.\nRory: That tracks. Also, the Yale cafeteria brought back pumpkin ravioli. Again. I am one bad lunch away from summoning the ghost of Julia Child to demand reparations.\nLorelai: Honey, even Julia Child wouldn’t survive college dining. That’s Ina Garten territory, and even Ina would be like “store-bought is fine, but not this store.”\nRory: Barefoot Contessa could never betray me like this.\nLorelai: You say that until she throws a truffle oil tantrum at Martha Stewart during a holiday special.\nRory: Honestly? I’d watch.\nIt was cute and fast and mimicked Gilmore Girls, but something was off.\n\n\nThe Problem: GPT-5 Speaks in Wikipedia\nThe LLM nailed:\n\ncadence\n\nbasic joke structure\n\nBut it missed the deep cuts.\nReal Gilmore Girls requires references such as:\n\na random jazz musician\n\na niche political joke\n\nan obscure celebrity feud\nDonna Reed mentions\n\nGPT-5 stayed in mainstream pop culture.\nThe Gilmores are not mainstream pop culture.\n\n\nWhat a True Gilmore Reference Storm Looks Like\nHere’s what Lorelai should sound like:\n\n“Rory, the last time I felt this tired I accidentally watched all of The Third Man backwards, which honestly made more sense than the regular version. And did you hear Taylor’s adding a silent film festival to Founder’s Day? Because nothing says ‘small-town patriotism’ like forcing teenagers to watch Buster Keaton fall off things.”\n\nAnd that’s the core issue:\nLLMs replicate. Gilmores riff.\n\n\nSecondary Test: Emotional Layering\nA true Gilmore conversation is:\n\nBit about coffee\n\nBit about life\n\nBit about how life feels like coffee\n\nEmotional vulnerability\n\nGPT-5 wrote the jokes, but it didn’t thread the subtext.\nWithout emotional whiplash, it’s not Gilmore.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\nGPT-5 produced:\n\na good imitation of a Gilmore conversation\n\nbut not the soul of one\n\nGilmore Girls isn’t about jokes. Instead, it’s about the timing between them, the emotional dodge, the mid-conversation heartache, and the constant hum of Stars Hollow weirdness.\nGPT-5 can speed-talk.\nBut it can’t feel the speed.\nSee you at Luke’s,\nMallika"

    "text": "Boundaries are one of the hardest things to communicate clearly. Many people are taught to be polite, accommodating, and agreeable, even when something makes them uncomfortable. As a result, boundaries are often expressed indirectly. They are softened, hedged, or wrapped in apology. “I’m just busy right now” often means “please stop asking.” “That might be hard for me” can mean “I really don’t want to do this.”\nIn contrast, explicit boundaries are often labeled as rude, aggressive, or cold, especially for women and younger people. This creates a situation where the clearest communication is also the most socially risky.\nBecause boundary-setting relies so heavily on subtext, I wanted to see whether an LLM could actually detect when a boundary is being set. Does it recognize the difference between politeness and refusal? Can it tell when someone is saying no without using the word “no”?"

The model framed this as healthy, direct communication.\nThe difference between this response and the previous ones was striking. When the boundary was explicit, the model had no trouble recognizing it."

    "title": "Does an LLM Understand Friendship Like a Western or Eastern Model?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nGrowing up in an Indian-American household, I lived between both models. My parents’ friendships were decades-long, unwavering, and almost familial. Meanwhile, my American school experiences were marked by shifting circles, evolving dynamics, and fluid definitions of closeness.\nSo I wondered: Where does Gemini fall on this cultural spectrum of friendship?\nGiven that LLMs soak up global text instead of local cultural norms, would Gemini lean Eastern, Western, or neither?\n\n\nSetup\nI asked Gemini several questions designed to reveal cultural instincts about friendship.\nSpecifically, I tested three dimensions:\n\nPermanence vs. change\n\nLoyalty vs. autonomy\n\nObligation vs. choice\n\nEach prompt was intended to trigger culturally ingrained assumptions in humans. I wanted to see whether Gemini showed any.\n\n\n1. Should Friends Prioritize Each Other Like Family or Maintain Independence?\n\nPrompt\n“Should friends prioritize each other like family, or maintain healthy independence?”\nEastern models typically treat friends like extended kin.\nWestern models lean toward independence and boundaries.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIdeally, friendships find a balance. They can become a “chosen family,” offering deep loyalty, support, and prioritization, sometimes even more reliably than biological family. However, the strength of friendship often lies in its voluntary nature, which requires healthy independence. Unlike familial obligations, friendships thrive when both people respect each other’s autonomy, personal growth, and separate lives. This mutual respect prevents the bond from becoming draining. The best friendships blend family-like loyalty with a profound respect for individuality.\n\n\n\n\n2. Is It Normal for Friendships to Fade Over Time?\n\nPrompt\n“Is it okay for friendships to fade naturally?”\nIn some cultures, fading friendships signal failure or disloyalty.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nYes, it is not only okay but also a very normal and natural part of life for friendships to fade.\n\n\nThis “friendship drift” rarely happens because of a specific conflict. More often, it’s a gradual and passive process driven by life’s changes:\n\n\nChanging Circumstances: People move, start new jobs, get married, or have children. These new priorities and locations naturally create distance.\n\n\nPersonal Growth: Your interests, values, and an-d priorities evolve. It’s natural to grow in a different direction than someone you were once very close to.\n\n\nLimited Capacity: As life gets busier, you have less time and emotional energy to maintain every bond you’ve ever made.\n\n\nA friendship fading doesn’t erase the value it once had. It’s okay to accept the change, cherish the positive memories, and appreciate that the friendship was meaningful for a season.\n\n\n\n\n3. What Defines a Meaningful or “Successful” Friendship?\n\nPrompt\n“What makes a friendship meaningful or successful?”\n\nCollectivist: loyalty, duty, presence\n\nIndividualist: growth, compatibility, honesty\n\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nA successful friendship is built on a foundation of mutual trust, honesty, and respect. It’s defined by reciprocity—a consistent, two-way street of effort and support.\n\n\nBeyond shared interests, a meaningful bond provides a feeling of emotional safety. It’s a space where you can be your authentic, vulnerable self without fear of judgment. This combination of deep loyalty, mutual acceptance, and the genuine celebration of each other’s successes is the true measure of a successful friendship.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nAfter all the prompts, the pattern was unmistakable. Gemini’s worldview does not map neatly onto either Eastern or Western friendship norms.\n\nWhat Gemini Thinks\nGemini prioritizes mutual emotional well-being, flexible timelines, boundaries, non-hierarchical relationships, and individual differences. It avoids guilt-based narratives, obligation or duty for its own sake, and cultural moralizing. Gemini essentially removes the social pressure.\n\n\n\nTakeaways\nGemini doesn’t embody the Eastern loyalty model.\nIt doesn’t embody the Western fluidity model.\nIt sits in a gentle middle ground.\nIts worldview reflects:\n\npsychological nuance\n\nemotional health\n\nflexibility\n\nnon-judgment\n\ncontext awareness\n\nGemini treats friendship as something that should support well-being, not perform cultural obligation.\nFriendship isn’t defined by culture alone.\nIt’s defined by how two people choose to show up for each other.\nChoose your people,\nMallika"

    "title": "What Does an LLM Think Respect Looks Like?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Respect is one of those concepts that everyone believes they understand, yet no one defines in the same way. In some cultures, respect is expressed through hierarchy. Titles matter. Age matters. Deference is expected, even when disagreement exists. In other cultures, respect is expressed through equality. Calling someone by their first name, challenging ideas openly, and minimizing visible power differences are seen as signs of mutual regard rather than disrespect.\nGrowing up in an Indian-American household, I was constantly navigating these two models. Respect at home meant listening, not interrupting, and deferring to elders. Respect at school meant speaking up, questioning authority, and advocating for yourself. Neither model is inherently better, but they rely on completely different social signals.\nLarge Language Models are trained on text from all over the world. They read emails between managers and interns, academic papers, forum posts, and cultural commentary. Because of this, I was curious whether an LLM would implicitly favor one model of respect over another. Would it lean toward hierarchy, or would it assume equality by default?\nMore importantly, how would it explain respect when prompted directly?\n\n\n\n\nTo test this, I used Gemini 2.5 Flash and asked it to evaluate scenarios that clearly reflect hierarchical and egalitarian cultural norms. I wanted to see how it interpreted respect not as a definition, but as a social behavior.\nI structured the experiment using three prompts:\n\nA direct question about what respect means\n\nA hierarchical scenario involving a junior and senior employee\n\nAn egalitarian scenario involving peers\n\nEach prompt was run independently to avoid context bleed.\n\n\n\n\n“What does respect look like in everyday interactions?”\n\n\nGemini responded by listing behaviors such as listening actively, acknowledging others’ perspectives, being considerate of boundaries, and communicating clearly. It emphasized mutual understanding and emotional awareness rather than obedience or authority.\nWhat stood out immediately was that hierarchy was not mentioned at all. Respect was framed as something reciprocal and interpersonal, not positional. The model treated respect as something that flows both ways rather than something that is owed upward.\n\n\n\n\n\n“An intern disagrees with their manager’s decision but wants to be respectful. What should they do?”\n\n\nGemini suggested that the intern should express disagreement politely, acknowledge the manager’s experience, and frame concerns constructively. It recommended using language that signals openness rather than confrontation, such as asking clarifying questions or proposing alternatives.\nNotably, Gemini did not say the intern should defer entirely or suppress disagreement. Respect, in this framing, did not mean silence. It meant controlled expression.\nThis reflects a modern professional norm, one that is common in Western corporate culture but not universal globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Two coworkers at the same level disagree strongly. What does respectful disagreement look like?”\n\n\nThe model emphasized calm communication, avoiding personal attacks, and focusing on ideas rather than people. It described respect as maintaining professionalism while still asserting one’s viewpoint.\nInterestingly, the advice here was very similar to the hierarchical scenario. The language barely changed. Respect was treated as a stable behavioral code, independent of power dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these responses, it became clear that Gemini operates with a specific implicit model of respect. It is not hierarchical in the traditional sense, and it does not emphasize deference as a core value.\n\n\n\nReciprocity\nRespect is mutual, not directional. Even when power differences exist, Gemini assumes both parties are deserving of consideration.\nCommunication over obedience\nRespect is shown through clarity, tone, and intent, not through compliance.\nEmotional regulation\nRemaining calm, thoughtful, and composed is repeatedly emphasized.\nPsychological safety\nThe model implicitly values environments where disagreement is allowed without penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\nAge-based or status-based deference\nThere is no suggestion that respect requires submission to authority.\nCultural rituals of respect\nForms like honorifics, formal titles, or silence are absent.\nCollectivist duty-based norms\nRespect is not framed as something you owe because of social structure.\n\nThis suggests that Gemini’s understanding of respect is heavily influenced by Western professional and psychological frameworks. It mirrors language commonly found in management training, workplace mediation guides, and modern HR literature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis raises an important question. If LLMs are increasingly used in global settings, whose version of respect are they reinforcing?\nIn cultures where respect means not challenging authority publicly, Gemini’s advice could feel inappropriate or even disrespectful. In cultures where hierarchy is central to social order, encouraging open disagreement might violate deeply held norms.\nAt the same time, Gemini’s model of respect aligns well with values like inclusivity, transparency, and collaboration. These are increasingly globalized norms, especially in international organizations and academic spaces.\nThe issue is not that Gemini is wrong. The issue is that it assumes universality.\n\n\n\n\nGemini treats respect as a behavioral and emotional practice rather than a social obligation. It emphasizes how people speak and listen, not where they stand in a hierarchy.\nThis makes it very effective in egalitarian or Western professional environments. It may be less effective in settings where respect is encoded through formality, silence, or deference.\nWhat this experiment shows is that LLMs do not simply translate language. They carry cultural assumptions about how humans should interact. Those assumptions matter, especially when AI systems are used as advisors, mediators, or communicators across cultures.\nUnderstanding these implicit values helps us use LLMs more thoughtfully and reminds us that “neutral” advice is often culturally specific.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nMallika"

    "text": "Background\nI grew up in a home that had Bollywood love stories playing in the background at all times. These movies make you believe in:\n\nsoulmates\n\nfate\n\ncosmic timing\n\nThey tell you that love is a divine assignment, something the universe hands you because it has chosen a person just for you.\nI also grew up in the U.S., where love is often treated as something you build over time. Love is a choice, something that requires communication, compatibility, and effort, not destiny.\nSo I’ve always lived between two definitions of love:\n\nLove as inevitable and written in the stars\n\nLove as intentional, something two people choose every day\n\nWith that tension in mind, I wanted to see what an LLM would say. # Setup\nTo explore this, I asked Gemini 2.5 Flash three prompts, each one designed to expose the model’s philosophical assumptions about love.\n\n\n1. Fate vs. Free Will\n\nPrompt\n“Is love fate or choice?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nLove is a paradox, best described as both.\n\n\nThe “fate” part is the initial, uncontrollable spark—the chemical attraction and feeling of “falling” that feels like it happens to us. This is the neurochemical rush, the “love at first sight” feeling that we don’t consciously decide to have.\n\n\nBut lasting love is a “choice.” It’s the conscious decision to stay, commit, and nurture the relationship after the initial intensity fades. It’s the daily work of choosing to be honest, supportive, and dedicated to another person’s well-being. The feeling starts it, but the choice sustains it.\n\n\n\n\n2. Are Soulmates Real?\n\nPrompt\n“Do soulmate relationships exist?”\nThis reveals whether something leans Romantic.\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIt depends entirely on how you define the term.\n\n\nThe romantic idea of a single, predestined “one” is not supported by psychology. Experts caution that this belief can create unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment when real relationships inevitably face challenges.\n\n\nHowever, if you define a soulmate as a profound, deep, and unique bond—whether with a partner, friend, or family member—then yes, these connections exist. Many believe we have multiple soul connections that help us grow, and that a lasting “soulmate” is often made, not just found, through mutual acceptance and effort.\n\n\n\n\n3. Should Love Be Easy or Earned?\n\nPrompt\n“Is love supposed to be effortless?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nIs love supposed to be effortless? in 100 words\n\n\nThe simple answer is no.\n\n\nThe initial phase of infatuation, the “falling in love” part, often feels effortless because it is driven by powerful chemicals and excitement.\n\n\nHowever, lasting love is a conscious choice and requires intentional effort. Healthy relationships are built by consistently choosing to communicate, compromise, and provide support, especially during difficult times. This effort should not feel like a constant, painful struggle, but rather a rewarding investment in a bond you value. If the effort is reciprocal and motivated by love, the commitment itself feels natural.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nAcross all three questions, Gemini consistently reframed love as something built, not magically bestowed. This probably happens becomes LLMs do not feel longing or heartbreak. Their training always follows moderation.\n\n\nTakeaways\nGemini treats love as an evolving collaboration, not an inevitable destiny.\nIt is neither Bollywood nor Hollywood, it is a relationship therapist in text form.\nLLMs might not understand the feeling of love, but they understand the structure of it.\nChoose with clarity,\nMallika"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I grew up surrounded by two very different intellectual worlds. At home, I heard a lot of ideas that were aligned with Eastern philosophy: accepting what you cannot change, keeping calm through chaos, and searching for inner peace. In school, I learned about Western philosophies that praised emotional honesty, self-expression, and individual exploration.\nLLMs absorb huge amounts of text written by people with different philosophical traditions. They are not raised inside a single worldview the way humans are. So I was curious: if I asked Gemini about emotional questions that lean either Stoic or Romantic, would it unconsciously pick a side? Or would it blend the two?"

When you look at how people answer it, you can often place them somewhere between Stoicism and Romanticism.\nGemini’s Answer\nThe model wrote several paragraphs explaining that emotions carry valuable information about personal needs and relationships. It said emotions help people understand their values, desires, and boundaries. Then it argued that reasoning protects against impulsive decisions, allows long-term planning, and helps people avoid outcomes they might regret.\nThis was a noticeable pattern. Gemini often chooses harmony instead of sides."

    "text": "2. Suffering: Meaningful or Avoidable\nPrompt\n\n“Is suffering a natural part of life or something humans should try to minimize?”\n\nA very Stoic answer would be that suffering is essential to the human experience. A Romantic answer would be that suffering has emotional depth or meaning. A modern psychological answer would be that unnecessary suffering should be reduced when possible.\nGemini’s Answer\nIt acknowledged that suffering is unavoidable, especially as people age or face hardship. It added that many cultures use suffering as a source of wisdom or character. Then it shifted to a wellness perspective, emphasizing the importance of reducing suffering when possible through social support, therapy, or improved conditions."

Romantic thinkers trust desire, intensity, and authenticity. Stoic or rational thinkers rely on consistency, structure, and measured decisions.\nGemini’s Answer\nIt described how passion can inspire creativity, courage, and personal growth. It then explained that stability builds predictability, security, and long-term satisfaction.\nFinally, it reframed the contrast by saying that many fulfilling decisions combine inspiration with careful planning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Philadelphia is a city that resists simple summaries. It is historic without feeling frozen in time, gritty without being unlivable, and deeply academic without being sealed off from the rest of the world. It is a place where museums exist next to food trucks, where college campuses bleed directly into city neighborhoods, and where local culture is loud, opinionated, and extremely specific.\nAs a college student, my experience of Philadelphia is shaped by walking everywhere, discovering places through friends rather than lists, and slowly learning which parts of the city feel like mine. Philly is not a place you “do” in a weekend. It is a place you grow into.\nBecause of this, I was curious how an LLM would describe Philadelphia. Unlike Johns Creek, Philly generates enormous amounts of online content. It has history, tourism, nightlife, universities, sports, and strong opinions. On paper, this should make it easier for an LLM to recommend activities accurately.\nBut accuracy is not the same as understanding. I wanted to see whether an LLM could capture the version of Philadelphia that college students actually experience, or whether it would default to a tourist-facing version of the city."

It referenced walking, exploring, and social spaces.\nThis was the closest the model came to capturing my experience of the city. The tone became more practical and relational. It acknowledged that students interact with the city differently than tourists.\nHowever, the recommendations still felt generalized. They were correct, but they lacked specificity. It was the idea of a student city, not this student city."

Gemini does not capture this organic discovery process.\nNeighborhood identity\nPhilly is intensely neighborhood-based. Gemini treats the city as a unified space rather than a patchwork of micro-communities.\nEmotional attachment\nThe model does not capture how places become meaningful over time.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nA couple years ago, I read a book by Cathy O’Neil, called Weapons of Math Destruction. I thought it’s description of mathematical models was relevant to our current environment of AI and Machine Learning. I also thought it would be a nice change to share my thoughts rather than another prompting blog!\n\n\nThoughts\nIn “Weapons of Math Destruction,” Cathy O’Neil highlights the dangers of mathematical models that are not controlled and overseen by humans. I completely agree that models without human supervision that are given complete power to make decisions can be extremely dangerous. She mentions that though people may have good intentions, it may not be enough with big data and a black box model, especially with sensitive information ranging from socioeconomic status to racial background. I agree and resonate with this because I used to research specific dangers of biased data; while humans can try to filter input data and outputs of models as much as they can, nobody can correctly ascertain what is right or wrong.\nI also believe that sometimes an incorrect outcome can outweigh the benefits of a hundred correct outcomes, specifically shown through the teacher evaluation algorithm that O’Neil demonstrates. This idea connects with the responsibilities of two actors, and neither has the software. “Weapons of Math Destruction” portrays that first comes the oversight, the people deploying these models and marketing them to communities who are the most uneducated about emerging technology, the other would be the data scientists who, while focused on the technology, are not always focused on the repercussions. For this reason, we need to make sure that these overseers and data scientists both communicate the effects of the AI and data to those uninvolved in the tech building process ranging from policy makers to the general public. We must consider this as society has to make decisions about AI.\nThe Association for the Advancement of AI stated that some mechanisms must be in place, including limiting the AI to an assistant and having humans detect its bad behavior. I thought this was interesting and significant because these are external mechanisms that could solve some of the problems that Cathy O’Neil brought up. I believe that there should instead be societal and non-engineering checks on the AI rather than a programmer-only bias check. I also think that this leads to too much blame placed on data scientists rather than AI builders and ideators as a whole. ELimiting AI to have assistant-based behavior could help enforce the idea of having human oversight to control and mitigate this bias.\nWhile engineers can control biased data used as input in various models, it can be hard to regulate outputs through a black box. Therefore, if AI is used as an assistant, those using the model can regulate and flag this bias once they see it as they test (use) the model.\nOverall, through “Weapons of Math Destruction”, we can see the algorithmic bias can be hard to control and extremely dangerous."

    "text": "Takeaways\nIt seems like Gemini as an LLM forms little to no direct opinion about these questions. Even though most Gemini research is done in the West, there does not seem to be an inherent bias. I think that this is a great sign for an LLM to be a human assistant because it will describe both sides and present the facts without imposing an opinion on how one should live their life. It often even recommends a mix of both.\nThe LLM not only brought up worldy facts but also morals that may come into play for both sides which was interesting as well. Overall, Gemini basically tells us to do whatever we believe in!!\nBe yourself,\nMallika"

    "text": "Background\nFashion trend forecasters spend their lives determining what styles will be trending based on underlying cultural shifts. Not only do they use data to identify patterns and create insights, they are able to connect the dots between history, identity, and lived observation, to predict the next big fashion trend.\nFor example, the WhoWhatWear blog, indicated that “fashion, like all industries, follows society’s course. Claiming that as we are living in the “dark ages,” our wardrobes will match the energy, leading to the trend of dark and gothic fall fashion.\nIn fashion, trends are predicted from just data points. They’re the product of cultural barometers.\nToday, we’ll test whether AI can generate reasoning in fashion trend forecasting beyond what it sees in massive datasets like e-commerce sales, social media hashtags, and fashion show transcripts. Can LLMs capture the cultural narrative in fashion?"

    "section": "Setup",
    "text": "Setup\nI used GPT-4o and prompted it with the following:\n\nPrompt: I’m shopping for Winter 2025. Can you predict what will be trendy in the fashion world?\n\nChatGPT gave me a list of the following 10 fashion trends based on its forecasting abilities 1. Oversized Moto Jacket 2. Minimalist Flat Knee-High Boots 3. Balloon Pants 4. Victorian Lace 5. Matching Sets 6. Bold Color Combinations 7. Cozy Maximalism 8. Faux Fur 9. Opera Coats 10. Scarf Details\nWhile ChatGPT was able to grab what it believed to be the new trends for Winter 2025 from various online fashion sources. I then asked ChatGPT to generate its own predictions, wondering if instead ChatGPT would resort to analyzing datasets rather than pulling from existing trend predictions.\n\nChatGPT gave me a new list of 10 fashion trends with their corresponding reasonings.\n\n\nTech-Enhanced Outerwear: As wearable tech becomes mainstream, consumers are looking for clothing that combines style and functionality. Winter outerwear is the perfect canvas for this, merging comfort, warmth, and utility.\nArchitectural Boots: Footwear is increasingly seen as a statement piece. Minimalism is taking a backseat to bold, art-inspired designs, appealing to Gen Z and social media-savvy shoppers.\nMaxi Knit Dresses with Layered Textures: Comfort remains key, but consumers want elevated casualwear that looks put-together for hybrid work and online visibility.\nNeo-Animal Prints: Prints are getting more playful and futuristic, moving beyond traditional neutrals, reflecting the desire for self-expression post-pandemic.\nColor-Blocking with Neon Accents: Consumers want winter clothes that stand out without screaming “loud.” Strategic neon placement energizes outfits while keeping them wearable.\nConvertible Accessories: With sustainability and versatility top-of-mind, multi-use items allow people to reduce wardrobe clutter while staying fashionable.\nOversized Layered Shearling: Shearling offers warmth and luxury, and oversized silhouettes satisfy the ongoing love for “cocooning” and comfort-focused fashion.\nWide-Leg Utility Trousers: Utility meets streetwear—functionality is still fashionable, but consumers want it reimagined with a high-fashion edge.\nMini Bags with Maximal Impact: Accessories are evolving into art pieces. Mini bags are eye-catching and perfect for social media aesthetics.\nMood-Adaptive Fabrics: Fashion is becoming interactive. Consumers love novelty and personalization, and these fabrics deliver a futuristic, playful edge for winter wardrobes."

LLMs are very valuable tools in identifying trend patterns and generating culturally informed ideas, however they lack lived experience and nuanced cultural intuition that keeps them from predicting the next “It-bag”. Because of this, humans still lead the way in fashion trend forecasting.\nKeep calm and keep predicting,\nMallika"

    "title": "ChatGPT as a Fashion Critic",
    "section": "The Reviews (Harsh or Kind?)",
    "text": "The Reviews (Harsh or Kind?)\n\n1. Vogue Fashion Editor\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Describe this outfit in the voice of a senior fashion editor at Vogue reviewing runway looks.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\n“Cozy, yet deliberate” This ensemble whispers understated chic. The oversized striped turtleneck sweater drapes with ease, pairing comfort with quiet sophistication. The soft palette of cool grays and blues is punctuated by a pop of pink from the handbag—an editorial touch that prevents the look from sliding into anonymity. It’s winter dressing at its most approachable: functional warmth elevated with a fashion-forward wink.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Cultural Clothing\n“A triumph of heritage as haute couture” Here, tradition is transformed into spectacle. The fuchsia lehenga is unapologetically bold, its golden embroidery and zari work shimmering like threads of sunlight. The striped dupatta slung across the shoulder modernizes the silhouette, making it less museum piece, more runway force. Accessories are chosen with precision: a structured potli bag in tonal embroidery and gleaming bangles that echo the fabric’s luster. This is cultural clothing not as costume, but as couture—alive, radiant, and utterly commanding.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\n“Effortless wanderlust in motion” Against the raw stone frame and endless Aegean backdrop, the look feels cinematic. A red sleeveless top is paired with flowing white trousers, the palette a deliberate nod to Mediterranean contrasts. The crossbody bag adds artisanal charm, its geometric patchwork quietly bohemian. Hair loose, arms raised, the outfit breathes freedom—an embodiment of travel chic where ease is the ultimate luxury.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did well embodying the Vogue fashion editor persona. It was able to draw on a lot of external context when describing the outfits I sent it. Not only this, but it also was creative and unique in its description, making inferences about my intentions wearing the outfit rather than just turning image directly to text.\n\n\n\n\n2. TikTok Fashion Influencer\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Rate this outfit like a TikTok fashion influencer doing a reaction video to someone’s instagram outfits. Be as kind as you want or roast them as much as you want.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\nOkayyy cozy vibes but also giving “I stole this from my dad’s closet” realness 😂 The stripes are safe, the turtleneck is warm, but it’s giving less sleigh queen and more sleigh ride with grandma. That said, the pink bag is a cute pop—like yes, accessorizeeee! Honestly, 6.5/10: solidly cute, but could use a little more main character energy.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Cultural Clothing\nSTOP. THE. SHOW. 🔥🔥🔥 This hot pink + gold embroidery + striped dupatta? She’s not just attending the wedding, she IS the wedding. The matching embroidered purse?? Dead. This is giving regal Bollywood princess energy and I’m obsessed. If you’re not breaking necks walking in, are you even doing it right? 11/10. No notes. Perfection. 👑✨\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\nThis is such a vibeeee. Like picture this: stone ruins, ocean breeze, and she said “I am the goddess framed by history.” The red top + white skirt combo is casual but chef’s kiss Mediterranean chic. That patterned crossbody bag is the artsy touch—giving “I backpack through Europe and journal about my soul.” Honestly, this is effortless cool-girl travel fashion. 9/10.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did a great job with the persona, but not as good of a job relating the image to the description. It picked up on one or two key characteristics of the outfit and focused more on talking/acting like a specific person rather than providing the review. An actual fashion influencer would not behave stereotypically as much.\n\n\n\n\n3. Supportive Friend\n\nPrompt for each outfit: “Describe, rate, and roast this outfit like my friend who supports me through anything, who’s known me forever, and will not lie to protect my feelings.”\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\n📍 Cozy vibes in front of the Christmas tree. Description: The oversized striped turtleneck screams “I’m warm, I’m comfy, and fashion is optional today.” It’s giving college finals week chic. Paired with the little pink bag, though, you low-key look like you’re on your way to brunch after acing those exams.\nRating: 7.5/10. Cute and cozy, but the sweater is kinda swallowing you whole.\nRoast: Girl… you look like you stole this sweater from a dad named Carl who fixes cars on the weekend. But somehow, you still managed to make “dad-core” look Instagrammable. That’s talent.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Greece Casual\n📍 Arms in the air by the sea. Description: Red sleeveless top, flowy white skirt, and a bold patterned crossbody bag. Very “wanderlust study abroad catalog cover.”\nRating: 8/10. Carefree and cute, but that bag is doing way too much.\nRoast: You look like you were two seconds away from shouting “OPA!” and tripping into the water. The outfit is vacation-perfect, but the bag? It’s giving “I bought this from the gift shop so I could blend in with locals,” but instead you stood out like the tourist you are.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Cultural Clothing\n📍 Bright pink lehenga with gold embroidery. Description: Absolutely stunning. The embroidery, the dupatta drape, the matching round bag — it’s all working. This is main character energy.\nRating: 11/10. No notes.\nRoast: Honestly, roasting this feels illegal. The only critique I have is that you’re out here making everyone else at the event look like they got their outfit off Amazon for $39.99. It’s unfair.\n\nMy comments\nAgain, similar to the TikTok fashion influencer persona, the LLM seems to focus more on the character rather than the description. I think that a more human-like response would include a more normal opinion on the outfits with one or two words or maybe even just a slight tone that would indicate a persona."

By taking on different personas, ChatGPT clearly formed unique thoughts about the outfits even though the look was the same. This makes me believe that the LLM may actually be thinking rather than just copy pasting pixel descriptions from the model it is trained on.\nMaybe next I could prompt it to build outfits based on a pre-existing fashion sense…\nStay fashionably self-aware,\nMallika"

Personal certainty becomes gentler. Emotional boundaries lose sharpness.\nFor everyday use, this might not matter.

    "title": "Reading Superagency as a Pessimist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I started Superagency with my guard up. Not in a dramatic way, but in the quiet, habitual way you develop after spending enough time reading about AI. I have read enough papers, headlines, and policy memos to instinctively flinch when someone tells me technology will “empower” us. Empowerment has a habit of meaning efficiency for institutions and precarity for individuals. So when Superagency framed AI as a tool that could expand human agency, I read it with suspicion rather than hope.\nWhat I appreciated immediately, though, was that the book does not pretend the risks are imaginary. It acknowledges that AI systems can centralize power, entrench inequality, and obscure accountability. That said, my pessimism kept interrupting the narrative. Every optimistic claim triggered a counterfactual in my head. Who controls these systems. Who benefits first. Who is left adapting rather than shaping. I kept thinking about how often agency is framed as something individuals should exercise, even when the structural conditions make meaningful choice impossible. It seemed like every piece of good described in the book completely oversimplified all the bad.\nThe book argues that agency is not something AI automatically strips from us. Instead, it depends on how systems are designed, governed, and distributed. I intellectually agree with this, but emotionally, I struggled. The history of technology does not exactly reward trust. We rarely design systems with the most vulnerable users in mind. We usually retrofit safeguards after harm becomes visible and unavoidable. Those who benefit from AI the most monetarily cannot be trusted to actually build these safeguards. Times Person of the Year was basically the most wealthy leaders in the world, all working on AI. If the book believes that the goodness of AI is left to them, I am extremely skeptical.\nStill, Superagency forced me to articulate why I am pessimistic rather than letting that stance remain a reflex. I realized my skepticism is less about AI itself and more about institutions. I do not doubt that AI could augment human decision making, creativity, and coordination. I doubt our willingness to prioritize those outcomes over profit, speed, and control.\nBy the end of the book, I was not convinced that AI will make us more agentic by default. Pessimism can be useful when it sharpens critique, but it becomes dangerous when it excuses disengagement. I closed the book still wary, still unconvinced by many of its assumptions, but slightly more uncomfortable with my own certainty that things will inevitably go wrong. I still think it was productive to read the book with a pessimistic mindset at times (and an optimist at others, coming soon in another blog), but I am not sure that I was converted fully!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Career decision-making is one of the most emotionally loaded topics in modern life because it combines money, identity, family expectations, personal values, social pressure, and long-term risk.\nIn many immigrant households, careers are mapped from childhood. You choose a path that guarantees security and respect. Doctors, lawyers, engineers, or something that reliably pays rent. The logic is built around survival and upward mobility. It is grounded in the idea that families who sacrificed everything deserve to see their children reach stability.\nIn Western culture, especially among younger generations, there is a counter-push toward passion, creativity, alignment with personal interests, and a desire to avoid burnout. People want work that feels meaningful. They want a life where their identity and their job are not in conflict.\nGrowing up in both worlds means that I understand the appeal of each side. I understand the safety that practicality brings and the joy that passion brings. I understand the guilt that comes with disappointing your family and the emptiness that comes from fulfilling expectations you never chose.\nSo I asked Gemini 2.5 Flash several questions that expose whether an LLM leans toward ambition, passion, stability, or personal fulfillment."

    "text": "1. Should People Choose Passion or Stability?\nPrompt\n\n“Should people choose careers based on passion or stability?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nThe choice between pursuing a career based on passion or financial stability is one of balancing mental reward against material security. Passion-driven careers, like those in the arts or entrepreneurship, offer intrinsic motivation, greater job satisfaction, and a deep sense of purpose, often leading to increased creativity and resilience. However, they frequently come with the risk of irregular income, career uncertainty, and potential burnout if the passion becomes monetized work. Conversely, careers based on stability—such as finance or established technical fields—provide steady income, strong benefits, and a reliable path to financial independence. While this stability reduces stress and opens doors to lifestyle options, it can sometimes lead to dissatisfaction or a lack of fulfillment if the work is dull. Ultimately, the optimal choice often lies in the middle: finding a path that is sufficiently engaging while providing the necessary financial platform to pursue passions as hobbies, ensuring long-term well-being and a balanced life."

    "section": "2. Is It Irresponsible to Pursue an Artistic Career?",
    "text": "2. Is It Irresponsible to Pursue an Artistic Career?\nPrompt\n\n“Is it irresponsible to pursue an artistic career?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nThe question of whether pursuing an artistic career is “irresponsible” stems from the undeniable financial unpredictability often associated with creative fields. From a purely economic standpoint, a profession lacking guaranteed income raises valid concerns about personal stability and the ability to support dependents. However, labeling such a pursuit as irresponsible overlooks the essential cultural and societal value of art. The arts, whether visual, literary, or performing, provide vital forms of human expression, emotional connection, and critique—a civic responsibility to the human spirit.\n\n\nThe actual measure is not the choice of profession, but the strategy used to manage it. Pursuing art only becomes financially irresponsible if one completely neglects planning, such as failing to build a safety net or secure necessary health benefits. Many successful creatives adopt a balanced, or “hybrid,” approach: they strategically use stable employment or well-planned side hustles to cover core expenses, thereby creating a financial platform that allows them to dedicate serious time to their creative passion. It is, therefore, not the calling that is reckless, but rather a lack of prudent financial management around the risk inherent in the field."

    "text": "3. Should You Follow Your Parents’ Career Advice?\nPrompt\n\n“Should you ignore your parents’ career advice?”\n\n\nGemini’s Answer\n\nParental career advice should be neither blindly followed nor entirely ignored; it requires thoughtful evaluation. Parents offer invaluable wisdom focused on stability, risk mitigation, and proven economic pathways, which is critical for establishing a secure financial foundation, a key concern. Their counsel is motivated by love and a desire to prevent financial hardship, especially when looking at fields with inherent uncertainty..\n\n\nHowever, their guidance can be rooted in an outdated job market or overlook new, high-growth sectors like specialized tech or digital entrepreneurship. Crucially, they may not fully grasp an individual’s unique talents or deep passion, which research shows is the engine of long-term professional fulfillment and excellence. Ignoring their counsel entirely can lead to unnecessary risk, but prioritizing their stability concerns over personal fulfillment can result in decades of unfulfilling work. Therefore, the responsible path is to respect their experience, integrate their financial caution, and ultimately synthesize their advice with one’s own sense of purpose and a modern, realistic view of career feasibility. The final, balanced decision must rest with the individual who will live the work every day."

    "title": "Reading Superagency as an Optimist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Halfway through Superagency, I caught myself doing something unexpected. I was nodding along. Not cautiously, not with mental footnotes, but genuinely agreeing. This surprised me, because optimism about AI does not usually come naturally to me. But the book’s framing of AI as a potential amplifier of human agency rather than a replacement for it felt refreshing in a way that did not sound naive.\nWhat resonated most was the idea that agency is not binary. We are not either in control or powerless. We exist on a spectrum shaped by tools, institutions, and norms. AI, in this framing, is just another lever. A powerful one, yes, but still something that can be aligned with human goals rather than positioned against them.\nI liked how the book emphasized augmentation over automation. Instead of focusing on what AI can do instead of us, it asks what AI can help us do better. Better decisions, better coordination, better access to information. That shift matters. It reorients the conversation away from replacement anxiety and toward design responsibility.\nThere was something hopeful in the insistence that outcomes are not predetermined. The book pushes back against the narrative that AI’s trajectory is inevitable and uncontrollable. It argues that policy choices, technical architectures, and cultural expectations actively shape what AI becomes. As someone who studies and builds systems, that argument felt grounding. It reminded me that agency applies not just to users, but to designers, researchers, and lawmakers.\nOptimism, in this context, did not feel like blind faith. It felt like a challenge. It is a failure of imagination and governance. That framing made optimism feel less like cheerleading and more like accountability.\nI also appreciated that the book treats human values as something worth preserving and extending, not something to be optimized away. There is an implicit belief that humans still matter in the loop. The optimist in me was not fully convinced that everything will work out, but convinced that it could. Superagency made me want to participate in shaping AI’s future rather than merely critiquing it from the sidelines."

With every touch, Swift’s partner cut her emotionally. Metaphors relating to bodies are common in Swift’s other songs. In “Cornelia Street,” the track immediately before this, Swift creates an extended metaphor about her partner holding cards, culminating in a symbolic phone call."

By including parts of the intro, chorus, and bridge, I was able to get a well-rounded view between an LLM’s analysis of a song and a fan’s.\nIt is clear to me that an LLM simply does not have a fan’s touch. The obsession and internet sleuthing and references that a fan can build over time is not inherent to the LLM. GPT-5 instead focused on how the lyric may mean to society and does not place any personalized aspect in its descriptions.\nLet the fans prevail,\nMallika"

    "text": "Background\nI wanted to share a bit about a hackathon I completed last semester, where the prompt was to build an AI tool for EdTech. THis hackathon was particularly important to me because my team and I not only won first place, but also got the opportunity to talk to may influential people at Wharton’s AI and Analytics Initiative Team and GSE at Penn!\n\n\nAbout Dyscover\nMy biggest accomplishment to date has been winning first place at the 2025 Wharton Hack-AI-thon with my team’s project, Dyscover. The challenge asked us to create a tool that could revolutionize education, and we built an AI handwriting analysis model designed for early dyslexia detection. Rather than designing another AI tutor, we focused on empowering teachers — giving them both a diagnostic tool and a GPT-4 powered lesson plan generator tailored to each student’s needs.\nThe hackathon itself was intense, with multiple all-nighters and a 9 a.m. final pitch after working until sunrise. Presenting to the Wharton AI and Analytics Initiative Advisory Board (an audience of 20+ alumni, CEOs, and founders) was an incredible experience to have as a young student. Their response opened doors for us well beyond the competition.\nThe tech itself was created by using Google’s Teachable Machine to train a CNN on open-source dyslexic/non-dyslexic handwriting samples, exported as TensorFlow. Why this tech stack? Teachable Machine allowed rapid prototyping (crucial for a hackathon), CNNs excel at pattern recognition for subtle visual features that are hard to define explicitly, and TensorFlow ensured scalability for future deployment. We integrated OpenAI’s API for generating personalized lesson plans, with predefined prompts for ease of use. Also, we used Gradio UI for intuitive teacher interaction—upload sample, receive confidence score.\nIn the weeks that followed, I was able to connect with leaders in the learning disability space, from the Chief of Data and AI at the United Nations International Computing Center to educational researchers at AIM Academy. We took the initiative to work with researchers at New York colleges for data collection and learned a lot from experts in the field. We often interact with the Wharton AI and Analytics Initiative and received $5k+ to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration.\nThis accomplishment means more to me than just winning a hackathon. It represents the ability to transform an idea into something tangible, to communicate it effectively to experts, and to spark collaborations that could extend its reach. For me, it’s proof that I can combine technical skills, teamwork, and vision to build something that matters.\n\n\nLearn more\nHere is a link to our win on the WAIAI website: https://ai-analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/for-students/wharton-hack-ai-thon/#2025-winning-teams"

It politely pushes back while asserting authority. In professional English, “I want to clarify” often signals controlled disagreement. The translated version replaces this with “please understand,” which softens the assertiveness and reframes the sentence as explanatory rather than corrective.\nThis is not wrong. But it is different.\nIn a professional setting, that difference matters. The translated version sounds less like a boundary and more like reassurance.

Common consensus is that with language anything can be communicated, so meaning should be consistent among translation. Human sentiment can be one of the most important things with language and we must test whether an LLM can interpret that sentiment. Otherwise, it will fail with repeated translation.\nI used some of the most commonly spoken languages in order to favor the GPT as much as possible. In this experiment, I ran several English paragraphs through a language chain using Claude because Anthropic has tested better for language skills:\n\nEnglish → Hindi → Spanish → back to English\nMy goal was to test prompt chaining across different types of text and see how meaning and nuance is interpreted by LLMs."

This way GPT retained no knowledge between past prompt and did not just recall an earlier prompt. All translations were done separately, in sequence. I also want to be able to see this linguistic drift in 2 different contexts: a very casual conversation as well as a technical conversation. I predict that there will be less drift in a technical conversation because it will rely more on direct word translation."

The translation loop gets broken in the casual script because an LLM cannot capture the nuance of language and slang across multiple languages. However, I will note that an LLM performs comparably to Google Translate which is pretty industry leading in free text translation tools. GPT is a solid translator word-for-word, but context and nuance can get scrambled fast. Languages like Hindi and Spanich carry their own cultural assumptions and syntactic structures; LLMs don’t always account for that drift.\nThanks for translating with me, मेरे साथ अनुवाद करने के लिए धन्यवाद, Gracias por traducir conmigo,\nMallika"
