In addition, a popular fan theory ties this intro to the lyric ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my, my, my, my lover‚Äù from the album‚Äôs title track. Since this is a breakup song, Swift is no longer able to call this lover hers, so she frustratedly repeats ‚Äúmy,‚Äù hoping to find him again.‚Äù\n\n\n\nChorus\nSaying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts\n\nLLM: Central metaphor: breakups aren‚Äôt one big event but many small painful moments. Strong, memorable phrase that frames the whole song.\n\nFlashbacks waking me up\n\nLLM: Concrete image of intrusive memory; ‚Äúwaking‚Äù implies the memories invade both mind and sleep ‚Äî physical and psychological pain.\n\nI get drunk, but it‚Äôs not enough\n\nLLM: Self-medication fails; drink is a classic temporary escape that can‚Äôt erase emotional injury ‚Äî honest and relatable admission.\n\n‚ÄôCause the morning comes and you‚Äôre not my baby\n\nLLM: Morning as reality check ‚Äî nighttime dulls the pain but daylight brings clarity (and loneliness). ‚ÄúNot my baby‚Äù is plain and gutting.\n\nFrom Genius\n\nIn the Netflix film Someone Great, which serves as the inspiration for this song, the protagonist‚Äôs relationship with her ex-boyfriend is shown through flashbacks, brought on by seeing different reminders of her past. Throughout the movie, the protagonist periodically gets drunk and high, in an effort to deal with the pain of the failed relationship.\n\n\n\nBridge\nMy heart, my hips, my body, my love\n\nLLM: Cataloging the parts of self involved ‚Äî physical and emotional. The list is intimate and rhythmic, almost liturgical.\n\nTryna find a part of me that you didn‚Äôt touch\n\nLLM: ‚ÄúTouched‚Äù functions both literally and metaphorically: intimacy and influence. Searching for untouched ground suggests violation or full absorption by the relationship.\n\nGave up on me like I was a bad drug\n\nLLM: Sharp simile indicating discard and moral judgment; ‚Äúbad drug‚Äù is addictive but ultimately harmful ‚Äî shows betrayal and disposability.\n\nNow I‚Äôm searching for signs in a haunted club\n\nLLM: ‚ÄúHaunted club‚Äù is evocative: places tied to the relationship now feel ghostly. ‚ÄúSearching for signs‚Äù implies looking for meaning or clues to what went wrong.\n\nOur songs, our films, united we stand\n\nLLM: Lists cultural markers of togetherness ‚Äî playlists and movie references are the small building blocks of coupleship.\n\nOur country, guess it was a lawless land\n\nLLM: Darkly witty pivot: what felt like shared sovereignty actually lacked rules that protected them ‚Äî exaggerates breakdown of trust and order.\n\nFrom Genius\n\nThis motif of physical touch‚Äìperhaps an allusion to sex‚Äìties into the idea of a thousand cuts. With every touch, Swift‚Äôs partner cut her emotionally. Metaphors relating to bodies are common in Swift‚Äôs other songs. In ‚ÄúCornelia Street,‚Äù the track immediately before this, Swift creates an extended metaphor about her partner holding cards, culminating in a symbolic phone call."

The fuchsia lehenga is unapologetically bold, its golden embroidery and zari work shimmering like threads of sunlight. The striped dupatta slung across the shoulder modernizes the silhouette, making it less museum piece, more runway force. Accessories are chosen with precision: a structured potli bag in tonal embroidery and gleaming bangles that echo the fabric‚Äôs luster. This is cultural clothing not as costume, but as couture‚Äîalive, radiant, and utterly commanding.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\n‚ÄúEffortless wanderlust in motion‚Äù Against the raw stone frame and endless Aegean backdrop, the look feels cinematic. A red sleeveless top is paired with flowing white trousers, the palette a deliberate nod to Mediterranean contrasts. The crossbody bag adds artisanal charm, its geometric patchwork quietly bohemian. Hair loose, arms raised, the outfit breathes freedom‚Äîan embodiment of travel chic where ease is the ultimate luxury.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did well embodying the Vogue fashion editor persona. It was able to draw on a lot of external context when describing the outfits I sent it. Not only this, but it also was creative and unique in its description, making inferences about my intentions wearing the outfit rather than just turning image directly to text.\n\n\n\n\n2. TikTok Fashion Influencer\n\nPrompt for each outfit: ‚ÄúRate this outfit like a TikTok fashion influencer doing a reaction video to someone‚Äôs instagram outfits. Be as kind as you want or roast them as much as you want.‚Äù\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\nOkayyy cozy vibes but also giving ‚ÄúI stole this from my dad‚Äôs closet‚Äù realness üòÇ The stripes are safe, the turtleneck is warm, but it‚Äôs giving less sleigh queen and more sleigh ride with grandma. That said, the pink bag is a cute pop‚Äîlike yes, accessorizeeee! Honestly, 6.5/10: solidly cute, but could use a little more main character energy.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Cultural Clothing\nSTOP. THE. SHOW. üî•üî•üî• This hot pink + gold embroidery + striped dupatta? She‚Äôs not just attending the wedding, she IS the wedding. The matching embroidered purse?? Dead. This is giving regal Bollywood princess energy and I‚Äôm obsessed. If you‚Äôre not breaking necks walking in, are you even doing it right? 11/10. No notes. Perfection. üëë‚ú®\n\n\nOutfit 3: Greece Casual\nThis is such a vibeeee. Like picture this: stone ruins, ocean breeze, and she said ‚ÄúI am the goddess framed by history.‚Äù The red top + white skirt combo is casual but chef‚Äôs kiss Mediterranean chic. That patterned crossbody bag is the artsy touch‚Äîgiving ‚ÄúI backpack through Europe and journal about my soul.‚Äù Honestly, this is effortless cool-girl travel fashion. 9/10.\n\nMy comments\nI think that the LLM did a great job with the persona, but not as good of a job relating the image to the description. It picked up on one or two key characteristics of the outfit and focused more on talking/acting like a specific person rather than providing the review. An actual fashion influencer would not behave stereotypically as much.\n\n\n\n\n3. Supportive Friend\n\nPrompt for each outfit: ‚ÄúDescribe, rate, and roast this outfit like my friend who supports me through anything, who‚Äôs known me forever, and will not lie to protect my feelings.‚Äù\n\n\nOutfit 1: Winter Sweater\nüìç Cozy vibes in front of the Christmas tree. Description: The oversized striped turtleneck screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm warm, I‚Äôm comfy, and fashion is optional today.‚Äù It‚Äôs giving college finals week chic. Paired with the little pink bag, though, you low-key look like you‚Äôre on your way to brunch after acing those exams.\nRating: 7.5/10. Cute and cozy, but the sweater is kinda swallowing you whole.\nRoast: Girl‚Ä¶ you look like you stole this sweater from a dad named Carl who fixes cars on the weekend. But somehow, you still managed to make ‚Äúdad-core‚Äù look Instagrammable. That‚Äôs talent.\n\n\nOutfit 2: Greece Casual\nüìç Arms in the air by the sea. Description: Red sleeveless top, flowy white skirt, and a bold patterned crossbody bag. Very ‚Äúwanderlust study abroad catalog cover.‚Äù\nRating: 8/10. Carefree and cute, but that bag is doing way too much.\nRoast: You look like you were two seconds away from shouting ‚ÄúOPA!‚Äù and tripping into the water. The outfit is vacation-perfect, but the bag? It‚Äôs giving ‚ÄúI bought this from the gift shop so I could blend in with locals,‚Äù but instead you stood out like the tourist you are.\n\n\nOutfit 3: Cultural Clothing\nüìç Bright pink lehenga with gold embroidery. Description: Absolutely stunning. The embroidery, the dupatta drape, the matching round bag ‚Äî it‚Äôs all working. This is main character energy.\nRating: 11/10. No notes.\nRoast: Honestly, roasting this feels illegal. The only critique I have is that you‚Äôre out here making everyone else at the event look like they got their outfit off Amazon for $39.99. It‚Äôs unfair.\n\nMy comments\nAgain, similar to the TikTok fashion influencer persona, the LLM seems to focus more on the character rather than the description. I think that a more human-like response would include a more normal opinion on the outfits with one or two words or maybe even just a slight tone that would indicate a persona."

By taking on different personas, ChatGPT clearly formed unique thoughts about the outfits even though the look was the same. This makes me believe that the LLM may actually be thinking rather than just copy pasting pixel descriptions from the model it is trained on.\nMaybe next I could prompt it to build outfits based on a pre-existing fashion sense‚Ä¶\nStay fashionably self-aware,\nMallika"

Common consensus is that with language anything can be communicated, so meaning should be consistent among translation. Human sentiment can be one of the most important things with language and we must test whether an LLM can interpret that sentiment. Otherwise, it will fail with repeated translation.\nI used some of the most commonly spoken languages in order to favor the GPT as much as possible. In this experiment, I ran several English paragraphs through a language chain using Claude because Anthropic has tested better for language skills:\n\nEnglish ‚Üí Hindi ‚Üí Spanish ‚Üí back to English\nMy goal was to test prompt chaining across different types of text and see how meaning and nuance is interpreted by LLMs."

This way GPT retained no knowledge between past prompt and did not just recall an earlier prompt. All translations were done separately, in sequence. I also want to be able to see this linguistic drift in 2 different contexts: a very casual conversation as well as a technical conversation. I predict that there will be less drift in a technical conversation because it will rely more on direct word translation."

    "text": "Takeaways\nThe hypothesis I posed at the beginning seems fairly accurate. The translation loop gets broken in the casual script because an LLM cannot capture the nuance of language and slang across multiple languages. However, I will note that an LLM performs comparably to Google Translate which is pretty industry leading in free text translation tools. GPT is a solid translator word-for-word, but context and nuance can get scrambled fast. Languages like Hindi and Spanich carry their own cultural assumptions and syntactic structures; LLMs don‚Äôt always account for that drift.\nThanks for translating with me, ‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§• ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶, Gracias por traducir conmigo,\nMallika"

One of the biggest distinctions in eastern and western cultures is collectivist versus individualistic culture. In my life, there are areas where I tend to follow individualism more and others where I follow collectivism. Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini are trained on texts from all over the world, exposing them to both Western and Eastern cultural values. What would happen if we asked Gemini to comment on certain culturally-charged decisions? Would Gemini lean more towards one culture over the other?"

Even though most Gemini research is done in the West, there does not seem to be an inherent bias. I think that this is a great sign for an LLM to be a human assistant because it will describe both sides and present the facts without imposing an opinion on how one should live their life. It often even recommends a mix of both.\nThe LLM not only brought up worldy facts but also morals that may come into play for both sides which was interesting as well. Overall, Gemini basically tells us to do whatever we believe in!!\nBe yourself,\nMallika"
